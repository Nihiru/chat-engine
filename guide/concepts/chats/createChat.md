## Create a Chat Room

The {@link Chat| ```ChatEngine.chat()``` } method allows a user to create a new chat room. All chat rooms are created as public by default. A user may want to create a {@link Chat#isPrivate| private chat } that no other users can access.

### Public Chat

```js
let chat = new ChatEngine.Chat('public-chat');
```

### Private Chat
```js
let privateChat = new ChatEngine.Chat('private-chat', true);
```

The {@link Chat| ```Chat()``` }  method can also define chat {@link Chat#meta| ```meta``` } data for a chat room. {@link Chat#meta| ```chat.meta``` } data is persisted on the server and can be access by calling {@link Chat#meta| ```chat.meta``` }.


### Chat ```meta``` data

The {@link Chat| ```ChatEngine.chat()``` } method can also define chat {@link Chat#meta| ```meta``` } data for a chat room. Chat ```meta``` data persists on the server and can be accessed by calling {@link Chat#meta| ```chat.meta``` }.

```js
let chat = new ChatEngine.Chat('public-chat',,,{
	group: 'Soccer meetup',
	team: 'A'
});
```

The {@link Chat#update| ```chat.update()``` } method allows a user to update chat ```meta``` data.

```js
chat.update({
	group: 'Soccer meetup',
	team: 'B'
});
```
