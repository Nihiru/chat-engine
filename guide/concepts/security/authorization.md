## Authorization

Authorization, not to be confused with [authentication](../advancedConcepts/authentication.md), is a default security feature offered by CE. CE relies on PubNub's [PAM](https://www.pubnub.com/tutorials/pubnub-access-manager/) service in order to grant CE users varying levels of access to specific chat channels, otherwise known as access control lists (ACLs).

Though the {@link ChatEngine#connect| ```ChatEngine.connect()``` } method only requires an user's ```UUID``` to authorize, one may additionally provide an ```authKey```. Then a user may be granted access to a specific chat channel against the specific ```authKey```.

PubNub accepts any ```authKey``` that might be generated by external services (oAuth, FB login etc.) or by an external server. It is also recommended to cycle an authKey after few days.
