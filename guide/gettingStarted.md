# What is ChatEngine?

ChatEngine is a highly configurable messaging client built with nodeJS which communicates via the PubNub realtime publish and subscribe service. Unlike many other PubNub products, that _can_ be timely to understand and implement correctly, CE condenses many difficult to implement chat related design patterns (built upon PubNub) into a single chat framework for ease of customer usage.
